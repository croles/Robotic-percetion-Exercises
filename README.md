# Robotic-percetion-Exercises

My solution to Udacity percetion exercises. In this project I propose my solution to the exercises prepared by Udacity for Robotics perception. Exercises can be found in: https://github.com/udacity/RoboND-Perception-Exercises

For the third exercise I only upload the final project. The parameters for object recognition learning should be decided individually.

Any body can contribute to improve this solution. Make your branch and pull your changes when they are ready.
